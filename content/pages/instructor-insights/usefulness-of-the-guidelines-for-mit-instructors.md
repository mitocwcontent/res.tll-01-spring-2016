_In this section, Dipa Shah and Leann Dobranski note that the guidelines are useful for instructors facilitating not only residential courses, but also blended learning and co-curricular experiences. They also describe how MIT instructors appreciate obtaining references to the literature supporting the guidelines and viewing examples of how other instructors have implemented the guidelines in their classrooms._

The guidelines include elements that instructors should consider when designing, delivering, and assessing educational experiences for students. [When the guidelines were originally assembled]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/instructor-insights/history-behind-tll2019s-adaptation-of-the-guidelines), there was an assumption that these educational experiences took the form of a residential course. Now, with so many courses at MIT using a blended model, instructors can still look to these guidelines for guidance. Many of the guidelines can be useful when designing co-curricular experiences as well.

In addition to obtaining references to literature that supports each guideline, we have found that MIT educators really like to hear about teaching practices used by others on campus. When you visit the guidelines pages, you will see examples of how MIT educators are implementing the guidelines in their classrooms. Many of the subjects highlighted in those examples also have corresponding OCW “[This Course at MIT](/courses/this-course-at-mit/)” pages so readers can learn more about the educators’ teaching approaches if they wish.
